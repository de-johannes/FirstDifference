# Part I: Foundations

This part establishes the foundational concepts of FD—from the unavoidable first distinction through the emergence of the K₄ graph that seeds spacetime.

## Chapters

### [Chapter 1: The Unavoidable First Distinction](chapter-01)

We identify the problem of axioms in physics and find a candidate for an unavoidable starting point: the first distinction D₀, which cannot be coherently denied. This chapter formalizes distinction in Agda and proves its unavoidability.

**Key concepts:**
- The problem of contingent axioms in physics
- Thesis D: Every expressible statement presupposes distinction
- The Agda representation of D₀
- The meta-axiom: Being = Constructibility

### [Chapter 2: Genesis — The Three Primordial Distinctions](chapter-02)

D₀ cannot exist alone. This chapter derives the necessary consequences of D₀'s existence and shows that exactly three primordial distinctions must arise, forming the Genesis: D₀, D₁, and D₂.

**Key concepts:**
- The impossibility of a solitary distinction
- D₁ (polarity) and D₂ (relation)
- The trinitarian structure
- The complete graph K₃

### [Chapter 3: Saturation — The Birth of K₄](chapter-03)

The Genesis is unstable. A fourth distinction *must* emerge—not by choice, but by structural necessity. The result is K₄, the complete graph on four vertices, which becomes the seed of spacetime.

**Key concepts:**
- The memory functional η(n)
- Irreducible pairs and forcing
- The emergence of D₃
- K₄ stability

## The Journey So Far

  <p><strong>Part I Progress:</strong></p>
  <p>D₀ → Genesis (D₀, D₁, D₂) → K₃ → Saturation → D₃ → <strong>K₄</strong></p>
</div>

From the single unavoidable distinction D₀, we have derived the complete graph K₄ through pure logic. In subsequent parts, this K₄ structure will yield spacetime dimensions, the metric tensor, and ultimately the Einstein field equations.
