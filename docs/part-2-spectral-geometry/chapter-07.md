# Chapter 7: The Drift Ledger

> *"The arrow of time is the arrow of increasing information."*  
> — Seth Lloyd

This chapter develops the concept of the drift ledger—the record of distinction-creation that underlies the emergence of temporal structure.

---

## Coming Soon

This chapter is under development. It will cover:

- The drift process and its formal structure
- Information accumulation in distinction-creation
- The connection between drift and temporal direction
- The ledger as a causal record

<div class="insight-box">
  <p>The drift ledger tracks the irreversible process of distinction accumulation. This irreversibility is the seed from which time emerges in Part III.</p>
