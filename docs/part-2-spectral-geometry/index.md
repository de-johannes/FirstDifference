# Part II: Spectral Geometry

This part develops the spectral analysis of K₄ that yields three-dimensional space. From the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian, we derive the embedding dimension and the geometric structure that underlies physical space.

## Chapters

### [Chapter 4: The Complete Graph K₄](chapter-04)

We study K₄—the complete graph on four vertices—in detail. This structure, derived from saturation, is the skeleton of a tetrahedron and the seed of spacetime.

**Key concepts:**
- Four vertices, six edges
- K₄ as the tetrahedron skeleton
- Graph-theoretic properties (degree, planarity, chromatic number)
- The uniqueness of K₄ as the stable fixed point

### [Chapter 5: The Graph Laplacian](chapter-05)

We construct the Laplacian operator for K₄ and compute its eigenvalues. The result—{0, 4, 4, 4}—contains the crucial three-fold degeneracy that will yield three spatial dimensions.

**Key concepts:**
- The Laplacian matrix L = D − A
- Eigenvalues {0, 4, 4, 4}
- Three-fold degeneracy
- Connection to spectral geometry

### [Chapter 6: Three-Dimensional Emergence](chapter-06)

The three-fold degeneracy of the Laplacian eigenvalue λ = 4 corresponds to three spatial dimensions. We construct the eigenvectors, define spectral coordinates, and embed K₄ as a tetrahedron in ℝ³.

**Key concepts:**
- Eigenvectors φ₁, φ₂, φ₃
- Spectral coordinates
- Tetrahedral embedding
- The deep result: d = 3

### [Chapter 7: The Drift Ledger](chapter-07)

Coming soon — This chapter develops the drift process and its role in the emergence of structure.

## The Journey So Far

<div class="chain-box">
  <p><strong>Part II Progress:</strong></p>
  <p>K₄ → Laplacian L → Eigenvalues {0, 4, 4, 4} → <strong>d = 3 spatial dimensions</strong></p>
</div>

From the K₄ graph derived in Part I, we extract three spatial dimensions through spectral analysis. The number 3 is not assumed but computed from the structure of K₄, which itself emerged necessarily from the unavoidability of distinction.
