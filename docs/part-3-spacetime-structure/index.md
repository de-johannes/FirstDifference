# Part III: Spacetime Structure

This part derives the full 3+1 dimensional spacetime structure, including the Lorentz signature and the metric tensor. From the irreversibility of the drift process, we obtain the temporal dimension with its characteristic negative signature.

## Chapters

### [Chapter 8: From Space to Spacetime — The Emergence of Time](chapter-08)

We have derived three-dimensional space. Now we derive time from the irreversibility of the drift process. The Lorentz signature (−1, +1, +1, +1) emerges from the asymmetry between reversible spatial directions and irreversible temporal flow.

**Key concepts:**
- Drift irreversibility
- Time as the fourth dimension
- Signature from symmetry breaking
- The Lorentz metric

### [Chapter 9: The Metric Tensor](chapter-09)

With signature established, we construct the metric tensor from K₄ structure. The conformal factor φ² = 3 emerges from vertex degree, and uniform K₄ yields vanishing Christoffel symbols (local flatness).

**Key concepts:**
- Metric tensor g<sub>μν</sub>
- Conformal factor from vertex degree
- Christoffel symbols
- Local flatness vs. global curvature

## The Journey So Far

<div class="chain-box">
  <p><strong>Part III Progress:</strong></p>
  <p>3D space → Drift irreversibility → Time dimension → Signature (−1,+1,+1,+1) → <strong>Metric tensor g<sub>μν</sub></strong></p>
</div>

From the spectral analysis of K₄, we obtained three spatial dimensions. Now the drift process provides the fourth dimension (time), and the metric tensor encodes the full geometric structure of spacetime.
