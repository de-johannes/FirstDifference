# Part IV: Curvature and Field Equations

This part completes the derivation by computing curvature and deriving the Einstein field equations. We distinguish two sources of curvature—geometric and spectral—and show how they combine to give the Einstein tensor with cosmological constant.

## Chapters

### [Chapter 10: Two Levels of Curvature](chapter-10)

DRIFE reveals a deeper structure than standard GR: there are two levels of curvature with different origins. Geometric curvature from Christoffel symbols vanishes on uniform K₄, but spectral curvature from the Laplacian eigenvalues contributes a positive cosmological constant.

**Key concepts:**
- Geometric curvature (Riemann tensor)
- Spectral curvature (from Laplacian)
- The cosmological constant Λ = 3
- Combining the two curvatures

### [Chapter 11: The Einstein Field Equations](chapter-11)

We derive the Einstein field equations with their constants determined by K₄ counting: Λ = 3 and κ = 8. The equations $G_{\mu\nu} + 3g_{\mu\nu} = 8T_{\mu\nu}$ are not postulated but computed.

**Key concepts:**
- Einstein tensor G<sub>μν</sub>
- Coupling constant κ = 8
- Ricci scalar R = 12
- Zero-parameter predictions

## The Journey So Far

<div class="chain-box">
  <p><strong>Part IV Progress:</strong></p>
  <p>Metric g<sub>μν</sub> → Geometric curvature (zero) + Spectral curvature (Λ = 3) → <strong>Einstein equations G<sub>μν</sub> + 3g<sub>μν</sub> = 8T<sub>μν</sub></strong></p>
</div>

From the metric tensor, we compute curvature and derive the Einstein field equations. The constants Λ = 3, κ = 8, and R = 12 all emerge from K₄ counting—no free parameters.
