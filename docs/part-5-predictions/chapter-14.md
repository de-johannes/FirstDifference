# Chapter 14: Cosmology

FD offers new perspectives on the fundamental questions of cosmology: the origin of the universe, cosmic inflation, and the nature of dark energy.

## 14.1 The Big Bang as Phase Transition

Standard cosmology posits a "Big Bang" singularity at t = 0. FD offers a different picture:

1. **Pre-geometric phase**: Distinctions accumulate without spatial embedding.
2. **Saturation**: The Genesis saturates, forcing K₄.
3. **Phase transition**: K₄ "crystallizes" into 3D space.
4. **Expansion**: Space expands from the initial K₄ seed.

The "Big Bang" is not a singularity but a **topological phase transition**—the moment when distinction-dynamics forces spatial projection.

  <p><strong>No Singularity:</strong> FD replaces the infinite-density singularity with a finite transition from pre-geometric to geometric structure.</p>
</div>

## 14.2 No Singularity

FD has no singularity because:

- Curvature is bounded: R ≤ 12/ℓ<sub>P</sub>²
- Spacetime is discrete at the Planck scale
- The minimum structure is K₄, not a point

<div class="theorem">
  <strong>Theorem (Singularity Avoidance)</strong>
  <p>The K₄ structure provides a natural cutoff:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Minimum length: ℓ<sub>P</sub> (Planck length)</li>
    <li>Maximum curvature: R<sub>max</sub> = 12/ℓ<sub>P</sub>²</li>
    <li>Minimum structure: 4 distinctions (K₄)</li>
  </ul>
</div>

The "Big Bang" is reinterpreted as the emergence of K₄ structure from distinction dynamics—a well-defined transition, not a singularity.

## 14.3 Inflation

Cosmic inflation is naturally incorporated:

- The pre-geometric phase allows arbitrary distinction accumulation
- Saturation forces rapid spatial projection ("inflation")
- Post-saturation expansion is slower (standard cosmology)

The exponential expansion of inflation corresponds to the explosive creation of spatial structure as distinctions become geometrically embedded.

## 14.4 Dark Energy

The cosmological constant Λ = 3 (in Planck units) emerges from K₄ spectral curvature.

**Observed**: Λ<sub>obs</sub> ≈ 10⁻⁵² m⁻² (in SI units)

The ratio:

$$\frac{\Lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\Lambda_{\text{Planck}}} \approx 10^{-122}$$

is the famous "cosmological constant problem." FD **solves** this problem through cosmological dilution.

### The Dilution Mechanism

The key insight is that Λ has dimension [length]⁻² (curvature = inverse area). As the universe expands, the characteristic length scale grows:

$$r_H = N \times \ell_P$$

where N = t/t<sub>P</sub> is the number of Planck times elapsed (equivalently, the number of distinction-creating drift events).

The effective cosmological constant at scale r<sub>H</sub> is:

$$\Lambda_{\text{eff}} = \Lambda_{\text{bare}} \times \left(\frac{\ell_P}{r_H}\right)^2 = \frac{\Lambda_{\text{bare}}}{N^2}$$

With N ≈ 8.1 × 10⁶⁰ (more precisely, N = t<sub>universe</sub>/t<sub>P</sub> ≈ 4.35 × 10¹⁷s / 5.39 × 10⁻⁴⁴s):

$$\frac{\Lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\Lambda_{\text{Planck}}} = \frac{1}{N^2} \sim 10^{-122} \quad \checkmark$$

### Why the Exponent is 2

The dilution exponent is 2 (not 3 or 1) because:
- Curvature is intrinsically 2-dimensional (parallel transport around a loop)
- This is independent of the spatial dimension d = 3
- The dimension 2 comes from Λ ~ R ~ ∂²g (second derivatives)

### Hubble Connection

From the Friedmann equation in de Sitter space:

$$H^2 = \frac{\Lambda}{3} = \frac{\Lambda_{\text{bare}}/N^2}{3} = \frac{1}{N^2}$$

Therefore H = 1/N in Planck units, giving t<sub>H</sub> = N in Planck times.

This predicts t<sub>H</sub> ≈ t<sub>universe</sub>, which is observed (14.4 Gyr vs 13.8 Gyr, within 5%).

## 14.5 Summary

The "cosmological constant problem" is **not** a fine-tuning problem—it is a **consequence** of:
1. The geometric nature of Λ (curvature, dimension [length]⁻²)
2. The age of the universe (N ~ 10⁶¹ drift events)

The only empirical input is the age of the universe. Everything else is derived from K₄ structure.
