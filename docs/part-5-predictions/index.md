# Part V: Physical Predictions

A theory without predictions is not science—it is philosophy. DRIFE makes specific, testable predictions. Some have already been confirmed; others await future experiments.

---

## Chapters

### [Chapter 12: Predictions and Testability](chapter-12)

We introduce "Königsklasse" predictions—those requiring zero observed input, zero calibration, and zero free parameters. Several have already been confirmed (d = 3, Λ > 0), while others await testing.

**Key concepts:**
- Königsklasse predictions
- Confirmed predictions (d = 3, Λ > 0, Lorentz signature)
- Testable predictions (black hole remnants, entropy corrections)
- The cosmological constant problem

### [Chapter 13: Black Hole Physics](chapter-13)

DRIFE predicts modifications to black hole thermodynamics: a minimum mass at the Planck scale, entropy corrections of ln(4), and the resolution of the information paradox through K₄ remnants.

**Key concepts:**
- Bekenstein-Hawking formula
- DRIFE entropy correction
- Minimum black hole mass
- Information preservation

### [Chapter 14: Cosmology](chapter-14)

DRIFE offers a new perspective on the Big Bang (as a phase transition), cosmic inflation, and dark energy. The cosmological constant problem is addressed through a dilution mechanism.

**Key concepts:**
- Big Bang as topological phase transition
- No singularity
- Dark energy from Λ = 3
- The 10⁻¹²² ratio explained

## Zero-Parameter Predictions

<div class="highlight-box">
  <h4>Königsklasse Predictions</h4>
  <p>These predictions require:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Zero observed input</li>
    <li>Zero calibration</li>
    <li>Zero free parameters</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Everything is computed from K₄.</p>

| Prediction | DRIFE Value | Observed | Status |
|------------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Spatial dimensions | d = 3 | 3 | ✓ Confirmed |
| Cosmological constant sign | Λ > 0 | > 0 | ✓ Confirmed |
| Signature | (−1,+1,+1,+1) | (−1,+1,+1,+1) | ✓ Confirmed |
| Coupling constant | κ = 8 | 8π in standard units | ✓ Matches GR |
| Black hole remnants | Exist | — | Testable |
| Entropy excess | ΔS = ln 4 | — | Testable |
